            <h2>What we use 3D printing for now.</h2>
            <p>Prosthetics. The ability to personalize 3D-printed prosthetics is undoubtedly one of the most impressive ways the method is being used. 3D printing is also employed to produce copies of patient-specific organs that surgeons may use for practicing before performing complicated surgery.</p>
            <p>Although still largely exploratory, 3D-printed models have been used in numerous cases to gain insight into a patient's specific anatomy.</p>
        </div>
       <div id="column2">
            <h2>Research that could be benefitial.</h2>
            <p>Researchers are actively working on 3D printing complex tissues like cartilage, muscle, and skin using living cells and biocompatible scaffolds, aiming to create transplantable organs in the future. Exploring 3D printed structures with controlled drug release mechanisms to improve treatment efficacy and reduce side effects. </p>
            <p>Research into developing biocompatible materials that can be 3D printed and gradually degrade within the body after use, minimizing the need for additional surgeries to remove implants.</p>

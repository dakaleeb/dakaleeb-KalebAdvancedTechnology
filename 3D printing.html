            <h2>Why is 3D printing important?</h2>
            <P>There are many advantages to 3D printing. You can make complex shapes and intricite Designs that would be hard to acheive with regular manufacuring methods. It is also importent for science because it allows researchers to create custom equipment. Researchers could also make physical prototypes that they can make experiments on. </P>
            <p>It also reduces the cost of manufacting equiment making it easier for everyone to bring their designs to life.</p>

            <h2>What ground breaking acheivments have we made due to 3D printing?</h2>
            <p>You can print things at a microscopic level. I dont know the uses for it, but it sounds cool. We can 3D print organs. This can make it so we dont have to exspirement on animals for medical reasons. 3D printing in space is an experimental technology that holds vast potential for revolutionizing space exploration by enabling astronauts to manufacture spare parts, tools, key components, and building materials on demand.</p>
            <p>Researchers have experimented with 3D printing different types of vegan cheesecake. They found that a graham cracker crust as the foundation for each layer of the cake was most successful.</p>
